# Architecture

The codebase follows a typed `src` layout with feature-scoped modules. The system is designed to evolve into a multi-tier closed-loop control system:

```text
Recipe / Goal
     ↓
Planner (STRIPS / High-level Goals)
     ↓
Supervisor (Reconciliation & Self-Healing Loop)
     ↕
World State (Central Snapshot)
     ↑
Perception (YOLO / Template Matching / ROI OCR)
     ↓
Reactive Controllers (Combat / Navigation / Loot)
     ↓
Executor (Win32 Input with Action Verification)
     ↓
Game Client
```

## Layers and Components

1. **Perception Layer:**
   - **YOLO:** Detection of dynamic entities (mobs, players).
   - **Template Matching:** Detection of fixed 2D UI elements and anchors.
   - **ROI OCR:** Targeted text extraction from specific UI regions (e.g. central loot/system log).
2. **State & Supervisor:**
   - **World State:** Immutable snapshot representing current assumed game reality.
   - **Supervisor:** Closed-loop reconciliation comparing desired state vs. observed state; detects stalls and triggers self-healing (`NO_PROGRESS`, `NO_MOBS`, `STUCK`, `INVENTORY_MISMATCH`).
3. **Planning & Control:**
   - **Strategic Planner:** STRIPS/Goal-based planner for recipes and high-level milestones.
   - **Reactive Controllers:** Modular state machines for micro-behaviors (Combat, Navigation, Loot).
4. **Execution & Platform:**
   - **Executor:** Decoupled Win32 input adapter; actions require post-execution visual verification to be deemed successful.
   - **User Interface:** Native Windows UI using PySide6 (Qt) to avoid separate web runtimes.

Classes are used for stateful controllers, supervisor loops, and resource bundles. Pure transformations remain functions. Business defaults and Win32 codes are named in constants, and user-facing text is localized in locale JSON files.

## Implemented bootstrap

US-006 establishes the typed foundation under `flyff_bot.features.automation`. Immutable
`WorldState`, `Action`, and `Observation` contracts are shared by the planning, control, and
execution boundaries. The `Supervisor` reconciles a `DesiredState` with each world-state snapshot
and reports the four failure flags defined by ADR-002; its no-progress threshold is configurable.

The initial `Planner` is a deterministic STRIPS-style search over typed planning actions. Combat,
navigation, and loot are separate reactive controllers whose `step` methods accept synthetic
world-state snapshots. `VerifiedExecutor` dispatches through a platform adapter and returns a
successful result only when the next observation is both confirmed and matches the action's
required observation.

The desktop presentation is a small PySide6 application boundary (`flyff_bot.ui`) that renders a
localized world-state summary. It introduces no web runtime. It is deliberately a bootstrap: real
Win32 dispatch, perception providers, and production goals remain separate future work.
